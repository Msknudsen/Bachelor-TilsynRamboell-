Rambøll is a nation-wide consulting engineering group in a variety of areas such as construction, transport and environment. \\
Their construction department in Aarhus holds an interest in digitalising the registration process on the building sites which today is carried out with paper and pencil.  

A broad array of methods have been utilized in the development of the product at hand. These include workshops, requirement specifications and literature searches. An iteration development process was used for this project. 

The department sought a product which would enable them to leave paper and pencils behind and replace them on-site with either a smartphone or a tablet. 
The product developed is Rambøll Tilsyn. Rambøll Tilsyn is a system which consist of an iOS application to smartphones or tablets with a Firebase backend. 
In the application a digitalised version of the analogue registration which is currently in place can be created. 

The product is currently a prototype which may further be implemented into a final product.
